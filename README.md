## Description
Cocktail-O-Clock is an dynamic interactive front-end application that seeks to inform the user about the cocktail of their choice, whilst adding a fun, entertaining element in the form a GIF.

The client informed us the application had to include the following:

- Bootstrap Components
- Interactivity - It needs to adapt to user input
- Use server-side APIs to fetch data from
- Limit the use of user-unfriendly elements like alerts, confirm and prompt pop ups.
- Be responsive on multiple device formats (phones, tablets, laptops and desktops)

The application takes user input (their choice of cocktail) and returns a page with the cocktail name, the ingredients it requires and the method to reproduce it. An image and a GIF is also provided for reference.

A list of related cocktails are provided on the side of the page, along with the option to add that specific cocktail to a 'Favourites' list.

## Technologies Used

The application employs two HTML pages - a main index file, and a file where the cocktail search results are displayed alongside some related content.

Bootstrap elements were incorporated into to application in order to streamline the styling, and the app utilises media queries in order to make the site responsive across multiple viewport sizes.

## APIs used

We've utilised three API's in this project

The API-Ninja Cocktail API was used to generate the name, ingredients and method to make the cocktail
The Cocktail DB was used to generate the cocktail images
