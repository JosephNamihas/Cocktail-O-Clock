# Cocktail-O-Clock

## Description
Cocktail-O-Clock is an dynamic interactrive front-end application that seeks to inform the user about the cocktail of their choice.

The client informed us the application had to include the following:

- Bootstrap Components
- Interactivity - It needs to adapt to user input
- Use server-side APIs to fetch data from
- Limit the use of user-unfriendly elements like alerts, confirm and prompt pop ups.
- Be responsive on multiple device formats (phones, tablets, laptops and desktops)

The application takes user input (their choice of cocktail) and returns a page with the cocktail name, the ingredients it requires and the method to reproduce it. An image and a GIF is also provided for reference.

A list of related cocktails are provided on the side of the page, along with the option to add that specific cocktail to a 'Favourites' list.
